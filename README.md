# HOSPITAL-DATABASE-
Hospital Database Project.

Description:
This project demonstrates the creation and management of a hospital database using SQL. It includes relational tables for entities such as GPs, patients, nurses, wards, treatments, doctors, and patient treatments. The database employs primary keys, foreign keys, and other constraints to ensure data integrity and relational consistency.


Features-
-Database Design:
Created relational tables with primary keys to uniquely identify records.
Used foreign keys to establish relationships between tables, ensuring data consistency.
Applied additional constraints such as NOT NULL, UNIQUE, and CHECK to enhance data validation.

-SQL Queries:
Developed queries equivalent to Excel's VLOOKUP to join and retrieve data across related tables efficiently using JOIN operations.
Extracted insights such as patient treatment history, doctor-patient assignments, and ward allocations through advanced SQL queries.

Technologies Used:
SQL
[Database Management System Used, MYSQL Workbench].


Learning Outcomes:
-Learned to design and implement relational schemas using SQL for real-world applications.
-Improved skills in writing optimized SQL queries to analyze and retrieve data.
-Mastered the use of primary and foreign keys to implement relationships in relational databases.
-Enhanced skills in writing JOIN queries for retrieving linked data across multiple tables.
-Applied database constraints to enforce data integrity and validation.
-Applied best practices for database normalization and ensured data integrity using constraints.
